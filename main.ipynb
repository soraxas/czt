    "\n",
    "Towards this goal, there are two options:\n",
    "1. **Feature Enrichment**: This process involves adding new features based on the existing data. For example, we can calculate the average transaction amount for each currency and add this as a new feature. \n",
    "2. **Feature Encoding**: This process involves encoding the current features and transforming them to embedding space via machine learning models. This model can be either pre-trained, or trained with the candidate dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the fact that the only two numerical features in the dataset are \"Amount\" and \"Time\", we will perform feature enrichment first. Optionally, we can also perform feature encoding. In this example, we use a graph neural network (GNN); we will train the GNN model in a federated, unsupervised fashion and then use the model to encode the features for all sites. "
